Java Wrapper Classes
Wrapper classes convert primitive data types into objects (e.g., int → Integer).
Used in collections, generics, and object-oriented programming.
Support Autoboxing (automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper) and Unboxing (conversion of wrapper to primitive).
Provide utility methods like valueOf(), xxxValue(), and parseXXX().
Common wrapper classes: Integer, Double, Float, Boolean, Character, etc.
Scanner Class in Java
The Scanner class is used to read user input from the keyboard, files, or strings.
Supports multiple input types: int, double, String, boolean, etc.
Key methods include nextInt(), nextDouble(), nextLine(), next(), and hasNextInt().
Best practice: Always close the scanner after use to avoid resource leaks.


A Wrapper Class is a class that wraps a primitive data type into an object. It allows primitive values (like int, double, char, etc.) to be used as objects.


Why Use Wrapper Classes?
Object-Oriented Programming: Java treats everything as an object, so wrapper classes allow primitives to be used where objects are needed.
Collections & Generics: Data structures like ArrayList and HashMap store only objects, not primitives.
Utility Methods: Wrapper classes provide useful methods for conversion, parsing, and operations.
Autoboxing & Unboxing: Java automatically converts primitives to wrapper objects and vice versa.


Conclusion:
Wrapper classes bridge the gap between primitive types and Java’s object-oriented features. They are useful in collections, data processing, and type conversions
